### Special words about the game we like
Xiletrade will provide help with his features but will always try to avoid all kind of abuses. From an external point of view, GGG have blurry politic about in-game trade mechanics and third party tools but we must respect their decisions making : Path of exile is and remain their baby. A trade revamped can be expected with the launch of PoE 2, we never know.
