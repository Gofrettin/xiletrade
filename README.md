### Special words about the game we like
Path of Exile is a highly complex and deep game that want to be accessible for all.  
Xiletrade will try to follow this pattern in development process and avoid all kind of abuse as long as GGG keep their politics about in-game trade mechanics. A full revamped can always be expected with the arrival of PoE 2, we never know.
